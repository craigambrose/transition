Hi <%= @pin.name %>,

You've been added to an online map of food and local resources in <%= @pin.region.name %>. You're getting this email because you filled out a paper form about the map in person, and then we popped your details on the online map. 

You don't have to do anything. 

We hope this map will help to demonstrate the great things happening in <%= @pin.region.name %>, and encourage people to celebrate local food and skills. You can look at the map anytime as it grows, by visiting it online at:

<%= url_for(:only_path => false, :controller => 'regions', :id => @pin.region) %>

<% unless @user.approved? -%>
We encourage you to log-in to the website, so that you can change your details at any time. To do so, click on the link below:

<%= approve_user_url(:id => @pin.user.to_param, :approve_token => @pin.user.validation_code) %>
